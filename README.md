- 👋 Hi, I’m @rqchoo
- 👀 I’m interested in the language acquisition of children in Singapore. I dabble in doodling, practising speaking Baba Malay (Apa khabair? Lu sua makan belom?), pole exercise, improv comedy and Chinese calligraphy when I’m not chipping away at my research data or teaching.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, eye-tracking and how to make kasut manek (beaded shoes).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything along the intersections of psychology, linguistics and education.
